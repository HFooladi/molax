# Acquisition Functions

This page documents the acquisition functions for active learning sample selection.

## Uncertainty-based Acquisition

Functions that select samples based on model uncertainty.

### uncertainty_sampling

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.uncertainty_sampling

### ensemble_uncertainty_sampling

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.ensemble_uncertainty_sampling

### evidential_uncertainty_sampling

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.evidential_uncertainty_sampling

---

## Diversity-based Acquisition

Functions that select diverse samples in feature space.

### diversity_sampling

::: molax.acquisition.diversity.diversity_sampling

---

## Combined Acquisition

Functions that combine multiple acquisition strategies.

### combined_acquisition

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.combined_acquisition

### combined_ensemble_acquisition

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.combined_ensemble_acquisition

### combined_evidential_acquisition

::: molax.acquisition.uncertainty.combined_evidential_acquisition
